<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

- Open your Terminal
- Navigate to the desired directory to which you want to clone the repository to
- clone it

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

- Basic understanding of Github
- Basic understanding of run project by npm
- Your machine should have Chrome or any of your favorite browsers and VSCode installed

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

- git clone https://github.com/khanh-devos/re-cap-nobel.git

### Install

Install this project with:

```sh
npm install
```

### Usage

To run the project, execute the following command:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Run tests

To run tests, run the following command:

- npx stylelint "\*_/_.{css,scss}"
- npx hint .
- npx eslint .

### Deployment

- You can deploy it using: github pages
